        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <p>Use the left and right arrow keys to look around.</p>
        <p>This will not work on mobile unless you know of
            some way to recreate the arrow keys on your
            phone.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>Press "Start" twice for the background. I don't know
            why you have to do this, but for some reason, it
            doesn't render on the first pass.

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>If you've ever played with a graphing calculator, you'll know
            that the functions f(x)=|x| and f(x)=-|x| make a
            hallway-looking thing (put in f(x)=xsin(x) for some funky
            wallpaper). It's a simple one-point perspective centered at
            the origin. So all I had to do was create a single point
            that I then used to draw a couple polygons from the edges
            of the screen.  To make it repeat and move in a circular
            fashion, I took the tangent of the vanishing point's x
            position.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond that, the only other trick was to add in a gradient
            background to really sell the idea of perspective. It
            makes it look like the hallway darkens the further down
            you look.
