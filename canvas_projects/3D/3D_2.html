        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Once I created two infintely extending walls, the next step
            was to create one infinitely extending wall that grew and
            shrank as you approached and withdrew from it. Rather than
            using the full height of the screen's edge, I just
            multiplied the screen's height by a function that converges
            to 0. I used 1/x, where x is the distance to the wall.
        </p>
        <p>This approach has some drawbacks, though. Since the wall is
            drawn from the edge of the screen, it can't be drawn if
            the wall's position is inside the screen. The vanishing
            point automatically loops back around and makes a triange
            on the opposite side of the view than desired.
        </p>
        <p>I needed to make a pillar at the end of the wall so I could
            use it instead of the edge of the screen. The issue of
            height was already solved. I could reuse the function for
            the wall height.
        </p>
        <p>Since everything was based on angles, I didn't need to do
            any matrix or vector math to get the relative position of
            the pillar. All I needed to do was find the angle of the
            pillar relative to the view position and reuse the simple
            vanishing point code from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>Once I had the pillar, I realized I didn't need it to draw
            an infinite wall. If I could join two pillars, I would
            have a quadrilateral that I could draw, instead of a
            triangle.
