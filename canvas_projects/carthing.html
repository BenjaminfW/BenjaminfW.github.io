        <p>This is just a little thing I whipped up while I was bored one day.</p>
        <p>I learned about keyboard input and messed with canvas transforms.</p>
        <p>I wanted to add physics that allow the player to interact with the environment
            (such as slowing down on grass and counting a lap), but I didn't finish that
            aspect of it. I'm hoping to come back to it once I have fewer things on my
            plate.
