    <p>This is the landing page for my github profile.</p>
    <p>Don't worry, I made it look bad on purpose, because I think it's amusing. However, I can't say that for the rest of the site.</p>
    <!--p>I literally just made this, so there isn't anything to see at this point. I really hope I keep this thing updated.</p-->
    <p>Here's a recursive link: <a href="BenjaminfW.github.io">Link!</a> And make sure to check out the counting button below.
       It took about as long to make as it will keep you entertained.</p>

    <button id="countbutton" onclick="doTheButton()">0</button>

    <h3>"Ben" vs "John"</h3>
    <p>My first name is "John," and my second name is "Ben." In more informal situations, I go by my middle name, "Ben."</p>
    <p>This has caused confusion before, so it's better that you learn about it now.</p>
